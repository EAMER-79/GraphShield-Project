# GraphShield-Project
GraphShield is a graph-based malware detection framework that analyzes dynamic API call sequences with high precision.

It converts API calls into temporal graphs, applies semantic vectorization, and uses attention mechanisms to capture both short-term actions and long-term behavioral patterns, improving on prior approaches.

We evaluate multiple Graph Neural Network (GNN) architectures including Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), Graph Attention Networks (GATs), Graph Isomorphism Networks (GINs), and hybrid Transformer-based models combining convolutional, recurrent, and autoencoding layers. These models capture structural and temporal features of execution traces and support both classification-only and combined classification-reconstruction strategies.

The datasets used (Dataset1 and Dataset2) are available here:[link](https://github.com/EAMER-79/GraphShield.git)

Access is restricted. To request access, contact eslam.a.amer@gmail.com or open an issue in this repository.
